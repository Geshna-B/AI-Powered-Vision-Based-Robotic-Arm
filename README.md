# AI-Powered-Vision-Based-Robotic-Arm
A real-time robotic arm control system using OpenCV for object tracking and hand gesture recognition. HSV thresholding, edge detection, and Hough Transform enhance accuracy. PySerial ensures low-latency Arduino communication, while PID control optimizes servo movements. Ideal for assistive robotics, automation, and human-robot interaction.
